# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a proof of concept web application that demonstrates how Google Vertex AI and the Gemini model can be used to analyze images for Digital Asset Management (DAM) quality control and regulatory compliance through a structured, multi-step workflow. The application will provide an interactive interface for uploading images, inputting metadata, and receiving structured compliance assessments through a 3-step analysis process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DAM analyst, I want to upload an image and have it analyzed against quality control guidelines, so that I can quickly assess compliance without manual review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL accept JPG, PNG, and JPEG formats
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the uploaded image
3. WHEN an invalid file format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the file
4. WHEN the image upload is successful THEN the system SHALL enable the analysis workflow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compliance reviewer, I want to input image metadata in JSON format, so that the analysis can consider contextual information about the digital asset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides metadata input THEN the system SHALL accept valid JSON format
2. WHEN invalid JSON is provided THEN the system SHALL display a validation error message
3. WHEN metadata is provided THEN the system SHALL include it in all analysis steps
4. IF no metadata is provided THEN the system SHALL use default metadata structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DAM analyst, I want the system to perform Step 1 DAM analysis with the exact role and task format specified, so that I get consistent professional analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Step 1 analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL use the exact DAM Analyst role prompt provided
2. WHEN Step 1 executes THEN the system SHALL follow the 4-part task instructions exactly
3. WHEN Step 1 completes THEN the system SHALL generate output with notes, job aid assessment, human-readable section, and next steps
4. WHEN Step 1 fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance reviewer, I want the system to apply the job aid checklist in Step 2, so that I get a structured assessment against all compliance criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Step 2 analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL use the complete job aid JSON schema
2. WHEN Step 2 executes THEN the system SHALL analyze the image against each field in the job aid
3. WHEN information is missing THEN the system SHALL leave job aid fields blank
4. WHEN Step 2 completes THEN the system SHALL output a completed job aid assessment following the exact schema

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DAM manager, I want Step 3 to transmit findings in both JSON and human-readable format, so that I can use the results for both automated systems and human review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Step 3 analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL generate structured JSON output with componentId, checkStatus, issuesDetected, missingInformation, and recommendations
2. WHEN Step 3 completes THEN the system SHALL also generate a human-readable report formatted as a professional communication
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL set checkStatus to "FAILED" and list all issues
4. WHEN no issues are found THEN the system SHALL set checkStatus to "PASSED"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the results from all three workflow steps clearly displayed, so that I can understand the complete analysis process and results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis workflow completes THEN the system SHALL display results from all three steps
2. WHEN displaying Step 3 results THEN the system SHALL provide tabs for both JSON and human-readable formats
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between each step's output
4. WHEN an error occurs in any step THEN the system SHALL display the error and indicate which step failed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a technical decision-maker, I want the system to integrate with Google Vertex AI using the Gemini model, so that I can evaluate AI implementation for DAM processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL authenticate with Google Cloud Platform using service account credentials
2. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL use the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for multimodal analysis
3. WHEN sending requests to Vertex AI THEN the system SHALL include image, metadata, and appropriate prompts
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the application to be deployed and accessible via a public URL, so that I can demonstrate the proof of concept to others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via Streamlit Community Cloud
2. WHEN users access the deployed application THEN it SHALL function identically to the local version
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use securely stored credentials
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display clear instructions for usage

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error handling and feedback throughout the application, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a clear, user-friendly error message
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL indicate connectivity problems and suggest retry
3. WHEN processing takes time THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators with progress information
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields or inputs that need correction

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow the exact 3-step workflow structure provided, so that the implementation matches the specified business process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow executes THEN it SHALL follow the exact sequence: DAM Analysis → Job Aid Assessment → Findings Transmission
2. WHEN each step executes THEN it SHALL use the exact prompts, schemas, and output formats specified
3. WHEN data flows between steps THEN it SHALL maintain consistency and pass relevant information forward
4. WHEN the workflow completes THEN it SHALL have executed all three steps in the correct order with proper data flow
