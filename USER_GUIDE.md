### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection
- JavaScript enabled

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Upload an Image

1. **Navigate to the Image Upload section**
   - Look for the "üìÅ Image Upload" section at the top of the page
   - You'll see a file upload widget with drag-and-drop functionality

2. **Select your image file**
   - Click "Choose an image file" or drag and drop your image
   - **Supported formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG
   - **Maximum file size**: 10MB
   - **Recommended resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher for best results

3. **Preview your upload**
   - Once uploaded, you'll see a preview of your image
   - File details (name, size, dimensions, format) will be displayed
   - If there are any issues with your file, you'll see error messages with suggestions

### Step 2: Add Metadata (Optional)

1. **Navigate to the Component Metadata section**
   - This section appears below the image upload
   - Metadata is optional but recommended for comprehensive analysis

2. **Enter JSON metadata**
   - Use the text area to input metadata in JSON format
   - An example structure is provided on the right side
   - The system will validate your JSON syntax in real-time

3. **Example metadata structure**:
   ```json
   {
     "component_id": "IMG_001",
     "component_name": "Product Hero Image",
     "description": "Main product image for marketing campaign",
     "usage_rights": {
       "commercial_use": true,
       "editorial_use": true
     },
     "file_specifications": {
       "format": "JPEG",
       "resolution": "1920x1080"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Validation feedback**
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmark: Valid JSON
   - ‚ùå Red error: Invalid JSON with specific error details
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warning: Valid but with recommendations

### Step 3: Start Analysis

1. **Click the "Start Compliance Analysis" button**
   - The button will be enabled once you have a valid image uploaded
   - The analysis process will begin immediately

2. **Monitor progress**
   - You'll see progress indicators for each of the 3 workflow steps:
     - Step 1: DAM Analysis
     - Step 2: Job Aid Assessment  
     - Step 3: Findings Transmission

3. **Wait for completion**
   - The analysis typically takes 30-60 seconds
   - Progress indicators will update as each step completes

### Step 4: Review Results

Once the analysis is complete, you'll see results organized in tabs:

#### Step 1: DAM Analysis
- **Analysis Notes**: Professional assessment by AI DAM Analyst
- **Job Aid Assessment**: Initial evaluation against compliance criteria
- **Summary**: Human-readable overview of findings
- **Next Steps**: Recommended actions

#### Step 2: Job Aid Assessment
- **Assessment Summary**: Overall evaluation results
- **Completed Job Aid**: Detailed checklist with pass/fail status for each criterion
- **Component Specifications**: File format, resolution, color profile checks
- **Metadata Validation**: Required fields and validation rules assessment

#### Step 3: Findings Transmission
This tab provides results in two formats:

**Human-Readable Report**:
- Professional compliance analysis report
- Clear summary of issues and recommendations
- Formatted for business stakeholders

**JSON Output**:
- Structured data format for system integration
- Component information and status
- Detailed issues and missing information lists
- Actionable recommendations

## Understanding Results

### Status Indicators

- **‚úÖ PASSED**: Component meets all requirements
- **‚ùå FAILED**: Component has critical issues that must be addressed
- **‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL**: Component meets some requirements but has minor issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Image Quality Issues

**Low Resolution**
- **Issue**: Image resolution below minimum requirements
- **Solution**: Upload higher resolution image (minimum 1920x1080 recommended)

**Wrong Format**
- **Issue**: Unsupported file format
- **Solution**: Convert to JPG, JPEG, or PNG format

**File Too Large**
- **Issue**: File exceeds 10MB limit
- **Solution**: Compress image or reduce resolution while maintaining quality

#### Metadata Issues

**Invalid JSON**
- **Issue**: Malformed JSON syntax
- **Solution**: Use JSON validator, check for missing commas/brackets

**Missing Required Fields**
- **Issue**: Essential metadata fields not provided
- **Solution**: Add required fields like component_id, component_name

**Incomplete Usage Rights**
- **Issue**: Usage rights information missing or unclear
- **Solution**: Provide clear licensing and usage information

### Best Practices

#### For Images
1. **Use high-quality source images** (minimum 1920x1080)
2. **Ensure proper color profiles** (sRGB for web, CMYK for print)
3. **Optimize file size** without compromising quality
4. **Use descriptive filenames** that reflect content

#### For Metadata
1. **Provide complete information** for all available fields
2. **Use consistent naming conventions** for component IDs
3. **Include usage rights and restrictions** clearly
4. **Add relevant keywords** for searchability
5. **Specify technical requirements** for different channels

## Sample Data

The application includes sample data to help you understand expected formats:

### Sample Images
- **compliant_high_quality.jpg**: 4K image that should pass all checks
- **compliant_standard.jpg**: Full HD image that passes most checks
- **non_compliant_low_res.jpg**: Low resolution image that fails checks
- **social_media_square.jpg**: Square format for social media use

### Sample Metadata Files
- **complete_metadata.json**: Comprehensive metadata example
- **minimal_metadata.json**: Basic required fields only
- **problematic_metadata.json**: Example with compliance issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

**"The uploaded file format is not supported"**
- Convert your image to JPG, JPEG, or PNG format
- Check that the file extension matches the actual file type

**"The uploaded file is too large"**
- Compress your image to reduce file size
- Maximum allowed size is 10MB

**"The metadata JSON format is invalid"**
- Validate your JSON using an online JSON validator
- Check for missing commas, brackets, or quotes

**"Authentication failed"**
- This indicates a system configuration issue
- Refresh the page and try again
- Contact support if the issue persists

**"API rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- The system has usage limits to ensure fair access

**"The AI service is temporarily unavailable"**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check if there are any system status updates

### Performance Tips

1. **Use appropriate image sizes**: Larger images take longer to process
2. **Provide complete metadata**: Incomplete metadata may require additional processing
3. **Wait for completion**: Don't refresh the page during analysis
4. **Use stable internet**: Ensure good connectivity for best results
